## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Dataset:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes / No)
- **Key Features:**
  - Customer demographics (gender, senior citizen, dependents)
  - Account details (tenure, contract type, payment method)
  - Service usage (internet, phone, streaming, security)
  - Financial metrics (monthly charges, total charges)

## 🧩 Project Tasks & Methodology

### ✅ Task 1: Dataset Understanding
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Identified data types and missing values
- Understood business context of each feature

### ✅ Task 2: Data Cleaning
- Standardized column names
- Handled missing values in `TotalCharges`
- Removed duplicate records
- Ensured data consistency for analysis

### ✅ Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed churn vs non-churn distribution
- Studied tenure, monthly charges, and churn relationships
- Used histograms, box plots, and count plots

### ✅ Task 4: Customer Segmentation Visualization
- Segmented customers into tenure groups:
  - 0–12 Months
  - 13–36 Months
  - 37+ Months
- Visualized customer distribution and average charges
- Highlighted lifecycle-based revenue patterns

### ✅ Task 5: Advanced Analysis
- Analyzed churn by:
  - Contract type
  - Payment method
  - Gender
  - Senior citizen status
- Identified high-risk customer segments
- Connected insights to business actions
